# pgio
pgio is the Planning Graph Data Model Specification. pgio aims to integrate all information related to building and planning into an easy to understand model that can be encoded in a wide range of formats, such as GeoPackage, GeoJSON and Simple Feature GML (SF-2). It re-uses codelists and concepts from applicable, well-established standards such as NAS (ALKIS), XPlanGML, and CityGML.

# Getting started
Initially, there is only a GML 3.2.1 Application Schema (pgio.xsd) available in this repository. This schema can be used to create and validate GML-encoded pgio data sets.
